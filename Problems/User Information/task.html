  <p>You’ve developed a beautiful cross-platform application used by many people. As a developer, you want to know how it is doing: what errors occur, what devices your clients use, what operating systems they have installed, and so on. For this purpose, you've created the <code class="java">CustomerInfo</code> class. In order to save all the necessary information in a convenient way, you want to create a method to send the information to the server and override <code class="java">toString()</code> for it.</p> 
  <p>Override <code class="java">toString()</code> to send information to the server as follows:</p> 
  <p><code class="java">Id: val_uid; Operation System: val_operationSystem; RAM: val_ram; Core Speed: val_coreSpeed; Timestamp: val_timeStamp</code></p> 
  <p>where <code class="java">val_uid</code>, <code class="java">val_operationSystem</code>, <code class="java">val_ram</code>, <code class="java">val_coreSpeed</code>, and <code class="java">val_timeStamp</code> are the values of the <code class="java">CustomerInfo</code> properties.</p>
